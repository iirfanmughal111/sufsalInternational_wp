Replaces "No shipping options were found", "There are no shipping options available" and "No shipping method has been selected" messages on the cart and checkout pages with the provided text.


== Description ==

The plugin allows one to quickly customize the messages WooCommerce shows to the customer when shipping is not available:
1. "No shipping options were found" on the cart page ([screenshot](https://ps.w.org/wc-no-shipping-message/assets/screenshot-3.png))
2. "There are no shipping options available" on the checkout page ([screenshot](https://ps.w.org/wc-no-shipping-message/assets/screenshot-4.png))
3. "No shipping method has been selected" notice appearing after a checkout attempt ([screenshot](https://ps.w.org/wc-no-shipping-message/assets/screenshot-5.png))


&nbsp;
Customers see a no-shipping-options message when there are no delivery options configured for their order because they choose a destination you don't ship to, or have too many items in the cart, or meet another edge condition. Providing a custom message may be useful to explain why shipping is not available and what to do next. You can also provide an actual link to your contact page.

Message examples:

- "You order exceeds 10 kg. Please [contact us](#) to get a quote."
- "Shipping to the selected country for orders under $100 is not available. Please add more items to your order or [contact us](#)."
- "[Product] is not available for shipping to the selected destination."
- "Unfortunately, we can't deliver your order. Please [contact us](#) for details."
